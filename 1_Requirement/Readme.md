# Introduction
Sorting algorithm specifies the way to arrange data in a particular data in a particular order. Most common orders are in numerical or lexicographical order. The importance of sorting lies in the fact that data searching can be optimized to a very high level, if data is stored in a sorted manner. Computer-Aided Engineering systems often use sorting algorithms to help reason about geometric objects, process numerical data, rearrange lists, etc. In general, therefore, we will be interested in sorting a set of records containing keys, so that the keys are ordered according to some well-defined ordering rule, such as numerical or alphabetical order. Often, the keys will form only a small part of the record. In such cases, it will usually be more efficient to sort a list of keys without physically rearranging the records.
# Objective of the Project
This deals with the presentation of information or data in an appreciable form and also to minimize the time used in searching for items. However, it can be seen that a well-sorted or organized file enhances easy searching of data while an unsorted one will pose little or great problems to locate a given item in a large list. However, the comparison process will be based on the following:
(i) Memory space used by methods
(ii) Different techniques used for sorting
(iii) Number of comparisons made during sorting process
(iv) Coding based on the sorting algorithm
